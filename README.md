**DoMD** (Do Markdown Docs) is a powerful tool for automatically detecting, executing, and managing commands in development projects. It helps you maintain your project's documentation by generating and updating `todo.md` and `done.md` files based on command execution results.

> üí° **Pro Tip**: When you think everything in your project is working correctly, run `domd` to verify all commands and update your documentation!

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automatic Command Detection** - Discovers commands from various project files
- **Docker Integration** - Run commands in isolated containers
- **Smart Command Filtering** - Skip specific commands using `.doingore`
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Extensible** - Add support for new command types and tools

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation & Basic Usage

1. **Install DoMD** (choose one method):

   ```bash
   # Using pip (recommended)
   pip install domd

   # Or using Docker
   docker run -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/wronai/domd domd
   ```

2. **Run DoMD** in your project directory:
   ```bash
   # Simply run 'domd' to get started!
   domd
   ```

   That's it! DoMD will automatically:
   - Scan your project for available commands
   - Run and test the commands
   - Generate a report of the results
   - Create a TODO.md with any issues found

### Common Commands

- List available commands:
  ```bash
  domd --list
  ```

- Run a specific command:
  ```bash
  domd run test
  ```

- Generate a report:
  ```bash
  domd report
  ```

- Patterns support glob-style wildcards (`*` matches any sequence of characters)
- Matches are case-insensitive

### üê≥ Running Commands in Docker with `.dodocker`

For better isolation and consistency, you can specify commands that should be executed inside a Docker container using a `.dodocker` file.

#### `.dodocker` File Format

```
# Commands to run in Docker container
pytest
black --check .
flake8
mypy .
```

#### How It Works
- Each line specifies a command that should be run in a Docker container
- Commands are executed in the `python:3.9` container by default
- The project directory is mounted to `/app` in the container
- The working directory is set to `/app`
- The container is automatically removed after execution

#### Customizing Docker Configuration

You can customize the Docker configuration by creating a `Dockerfile` in your project root. For example:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

# Install additional dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN pip install poetry && \
    poetry config virtualenvs.create false && \
    poetry install --no-interaction --no-ansi
```

DoMD will automatically detect and use this `Dockerfile` when running commands in a container.

## ü§ñ Programmatic Usage

```python
from domd import ProjectCommandDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = ProjectCommandDetector(
    project_path="./my-project",
    timeout=60,
    exclude_patterns=["*.pyc", "__pycache__/*"]
)

# Scan for commands
commands = detector.scan_project()
print(f"Found {len(commands)} commands")

# Test commands
detector.test_commands(commands)

# Generate report
detector.generate_output_file("RESULTS.md", "markdown")

# Access results
failed_commands = detector.failed_commands
success_rate = (len(commands) - len(failed_commands)) / len(commands) * 100
print(f"Success rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
```

## üß™ Development

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wronai/domd.git
cd domd
poetry install --with dev,docs,testing

# Install pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=domd --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
poetry run pytest -m "unit"
poetry run pytest -m "integration"
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
poetry run black src/ tests/
poetry run isort src/ tests/

# Linting
poetry run flake8 src/ tests/
poetry run mypy src/

# All quality checks
make lint
```

### Building Documentation
```bash
# Serve locally
poetry run mkdocs serve

# Build static site
poetry run mkdocs build
```

### Adding New Parsers

To add support for a new project type:

1. Create a parser in `src/domd/parsers/`
2. Implement the parser interface
3. Add tests in `tests/parsers/`
4. Update documentation

Example parser structure:
```python
from .base import BaseParser

class NewProjectParser(BaseParser):
    def can_parse(self, file_path: Path) -> bool:
        return file_path.name == "config.yaml"

    def parse_commands(self, file_path: Path) -> List[Dict]:
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
