**DoMD** (Do Markdown Docs) is a powerful tool that helps you maintain up-to-date project documentation by automatically detecting, running, and documenting commands from your project files. It generates and updates `TODO.md` and `DONE.md` files based on command execution results, making it easier to track what works and what needs attention.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automatic Command Detection** - Discovers and extracts commands from various project files
- **Smart Execution** - Runs commands and captures their output and status
- **Docker Integration** - Execute commands in isolated containers for consistency
- **Comprehensive Reporting** - Generates detailed reports in markdown format
- **Customizable** - Configure includes, excludes, and command behavior
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Extensible** - Add support for new command types and tools

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package manager)
- (Optional) Docker for containerized execution

### Installation

Choose the installation method that works best for you:

```bash
# Using pip (recommended)
pip install domd

# Or using Docker (no installation required)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/wronai/domd domd
```

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Run DoMD:
   ```bash
   domd
   ```

   DoMD will:
   - Scan your project for available commands
   - Execute the commands in the correct context
   - Generate a report in `TODO.md` with any issues found
   - Update `DONE.md` with successfully executed commands

### Common Commands

- **List available commands** without executing them:
  ```bash
  domd --list
  ```

- **Run a specific command** by name or pattern:
  ```bash
  domd run test
  domd run "test*"
  ```

- **Generate a report** without executing commands:
  ```bash
  domd --dry-run
  ```

- **Get help** with available options:
  ```bash
  domd --help
  ```

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Run `domd` regularly to keep your project documentation in sync with your actual project state!

- Matches are case-insensitive

### üìÇ Subdirectory README.md Support

DoMD can automatically scan first-level subdirectories for additional `README.md` files and execute commands found within them. This is particularly useful for monorepos or projects with multiple components.

#### How It Works

- DoMD scans all first-level subdirectories in your project
- For each subdirectory containing a `README.md` file:
  - Commands are extracted from the `README.md`
  - Commands are executed with the subdirectory as the working directory
  - Command output and results are included in the main report

#### Example Project Structure

```text
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Commands run from project root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Commands run from frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Commands run from backend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Commands run from docs/
```

#### Benefits

- Keep commands close to the code they relate to
- Maintain separate command sets for different project components
- Simplify complex project automation
- Commands run in their proper context

### üê≥ Running Commands in Docker with `.dodocker`

For better isolation and consistency, you can specify commands that should be executed inside a Docker container using a `.dodocker` file.

#### `.dodocker` File Format

```
# Commands to run in Docker container
pytest
black --check .
flake8
mypy .
```

#### How It Works
- Each line specifies a command that should be run in a Docker container
- Commands are executed in the `python:3.9` container by default
- The project directory is mounted to `/app` in the container
- The working directory is set to `/app`
- The container is automatically removed after execution

#### Customizing Docker Configuration

You can customize the Docker configuration by creating a `Dockerfile` in your project root. For example:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

# Install additional dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN pip install poetry && \
    poetry config virtualenvs.create false && \
    poetry install --no-interaction --no-ansi
```

DoMD will automatically detect and use this `Dockerfile` when running commands in a container.

## ü§ñ Programmatic Usage

```python
from domd import ProjectCommandDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = ProjectCommandDetector(
    project_path="./my-project",
    timeout=60,
    exclude_patterns=["*.pyc", "__pycache__/*"]
)

# Scan for commands
commands = detector.scan_project()
print(f"Found {len(commands)} commands")

# Test commands
detector.test_commands(commands)

# Generate report
detector.generate_output_file("RESULTS.md", "markdown")

# Access results
failed_commands = detector.failed_commands
success_rate = (len(commands) - len(failed_commands)) / len(commands) * 100
print(f"Success rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
```

## üß™ Development

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Adding New Parsers

To add support for a new project type:

1. Create a parser in `src/domd/parsers/`
2. Implement the parser interface
3. Add tests in `tests/parsers/`
4. Update documentation

Example parser structure:
```python
from .base import BaseParser

class NewProjectParser(BaseParser):
    def can_parse(self, file_path: Path) -> bool:
        return file_path.name == "config.yaml"

    def parse_commands(self, file_path: Path) -> List[Dict]:
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
